# Enter st.session_state
st.session_state is like a dictionary (dict) that persists across reruns of your app.
It acts like “app memory” for each user session.
So if you store something in st.session_state, it won’t reset every time your script reruns.

# key importance in streamlit
Every widget in Streamlit (st.text_input, st.button, st.slider, etc.) needs a way to remember its value across reruns.
key gives a unique identifier to each widget.
eg) import streamlit as st

user_input1 = st.text_input("Enter something")
user_input2 = st.text_input("Enter again")
⚠️ Here, Streamlit tries to auto-generate keys (like "text_input-0", "text_input-1").
This works fine as long as widgets are unique and stable.
But if you rearrange your code or re-run with different conditions, keys may change → state gets lost.

in this project key = "user_input" : “Store this input widget’s value in st.session_state["user_input"].”

st.spinner(): is a Context manager that you use with the with ...: syntax. -> it says do somthing 

st.rerun() -> sometimes you need to force a rerun immediately after some code finishes (instead of waiting for another user action).
